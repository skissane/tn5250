    When exiting SDA on S/36, 'Ready for Option number: 0, 2 ==&gt; 0'.
    Can't type anything!

    Under S/36, when exiting SEU, prompted for Y/N for some reason the emulator
    isn't sending 'Y', but will send 'N'.

    System request at signon screen (which is apparently ignored by the 400)
    causes an assertion/core dump.

    In an unsigned numeric field-exit required field, the cursor remains
    on the last character, but on pressing field exit, the last character
    is erased.

    Elaboration: There seems to be an additional FER state used for FER
    fields on most emulators; we don't support that yet.  When the last
    character in the field is typed, turn on FER flag.  When backspace/
    left arrow is typed, turn off FER flag.  Otherwise, inhibit
    display.

    A few more issues with SEU, too.  The first thing I noticed is that
    Client Access usually doesn't process a field exit just by spacing
    past the end of the field, but tn5250 seems to.

    When editing a DDS source member, the Len field has problems.  It
    should be possible to enter "+1" or "-1" (or +2, -10, etc.) in the
    field, but tn5250 reuses the "+" and "-" keys which makes this
    impossible.  I'm not sure what a good solution would be.  (I can still
    enter the info directly, without prompting, so it's not a disaster!)

    Also, field-minus in this field still does strange things, but not the
    same strange things in tn5250 as other emulators.
