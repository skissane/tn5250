  New TODO format - I'm going to write a parser for it for the CVS server, so
  you can browse TODO items from a nifty little web-page.  Actually, I'm just
  going to use an XML parser. -JMF

    Move SCS ``library functions'' from scs2ascii.c to scs.c, make them part
    of the library.  Include tn5250/scs.h from tn5250.h
  </item>

  <item>
    Look into how vim handles the ESC key, so that we can eliminate strangeness
    about how ESC A (for Attention) can act strange if pressed too quickly.
  </item>

  <item>
    Reimplement Save/Restore Screen/Format Table commands so that they send
    the saved data to the 400 instead of keeping track of it locally and
    handing the 400 a unique identifier.
  </item>

  <item>
    We are currently ignoring some useful information in the format table
    header (given to us with the SOH order).  This includes the `Operator
    Error Line' and a list of function keys which should be ignored (because
    they aren't applicable for a particular screen).
  </item>

  <item>
    Object-orientize translation map handling.
  </item>
