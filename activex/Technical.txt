For *my* information :)
 
How is a packet formed:

L1 L0 12 A0 00 00 04 00 00 03 CY CX F1 11 FY FX "FieldText" FF FE
                                   Enter                    IAC
                                       SBA                     EOR
L1 = Length1 of the packet
L0 = Length0 of the packet
CX = Current cursor position X
CY = Current cursor position Y
FY = field pos y to know which field it is
FX = field pos x to know which field it is
FF  FE = end of packet in telnet mode.
