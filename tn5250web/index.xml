    <h1>tn5250</h1>

    <p>This is the homepage for the free tn5250 emulator.  It’s
      sometimes described as “Linux tn5250”, although it
      works on FreeBSD and any other modern Unix.</p>

    <p>tn5250 is a telnet client for the
<a href="http://www.iseries.ibm.com/">IBM AS/400</a> that emulates
      5250 terminals and printers.  This function is the same as that
      provided by the 5250 emulator in IBM Client Access.</p>

    <p>The tn5250 project is kindly hosted by
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>.  Thanks!</p>


    <h2>People</h2>

    <p><a href="http://www.linux-sna.org/software/5250/">Michael
	Madore</a> is the principal author of tn5250 — he got the
      whole thing going.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.nacs.net/~jasonf/">Jay Felice</a> has done
      a lot of good work on tn5250 as well, and provided the CVS
      server and download site for a few years.</p>

    <p>Scott Klement has gotten himself into the ChangeLog a bit,
      too.</p>

    <p><a href="http://home.clear.net.nz/pages/c.evans/">Carey
	Evans</a>, your humble narrator, hasn’t done much; he
      contributed the initial
      <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/automake.html">automake</a>
      support and left it for Michael and Jay to get working, wrote
      the man pages, and got the project set up on
      SourceForge.</p>
